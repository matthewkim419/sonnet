<h4>BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h4>

<br>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;</br>
<br>Coral is far more red than her lips' red;</br>
<br>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;</br>
<br>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.</br>
<br>I have seen roses damasked, red and white,</br>
<br>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;</br>
<br>And in some perfumes is there more delight</br>
<br>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.</br>
<br>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know</br>
<br>That music hath a far more pleasing sound;</br>
<br>I grant I never saw a goddess go;</br>
<br>My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.</br>
<br>And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare</br>
   <br>As any she belied with false compare.</br>
